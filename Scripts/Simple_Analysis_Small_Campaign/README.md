# Analysis Scripts for Small Simulation Campaign

These scritps are a collection of quick analysis of different runs made within the small simulation campaign. The generated figures are prepared to be imported directly into MS Word.

## NAT_LoadInfeed

Getting information about the initally generated input data set within the NAT. Here a access to the single profiles of each profile set is possible.

## OAT_LoadInfeed

Getting information about the input data set used in the simulations. These can differ from the above ones, because the sequence of sets used in the simulation is a little bit different...

## OAT_Voltage

Analysing of the voltage simulation values and generating graphs.
